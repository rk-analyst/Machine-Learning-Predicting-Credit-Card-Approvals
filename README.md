# Predicting Credit Card Approvals


## Project Description

Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Project Tasks

The tasks through this project encompass the following:
1. Understanding the dataset
2. Handling missing values
3. Data pre-processing
4. Building a logistic regression model
5. Hyperparameter Tuning and Cross-validation using GridSearchCV
6. Finding the most optimal model
